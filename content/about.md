We're super excited to unveil the official Ortexo blog! We are super excited to use this to help educate and be more open with what we do here at Ortexo, our internal processes, and just to help educate those reading more on software, SaaS, and technology as a whole!

We are always looking for more ideas to post about, so if there's anything specifically that you'd like us to write about, please let us know! You can email us at [hello@ortexo.com](mailto:hello@ortexo.com) to let us know of anything you'd like us to write about, as well as any feedback you may have!
