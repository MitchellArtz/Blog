As many of today’s youth are aware, due to the infamous task of middle and high school “portfolio” building, personal websites are a great way to express who you are and to show off what you have done to whoever searches your name on Google. Personal websites can be handy when applying for jobs, meeting new people, or simply in establishing yourself in the vast domain of the world wide web. However, if you are going to take the time to create a page of the internet dedicated to the one and only you, you may as well do it right.

The first step in creating any website is knowing what you want. The best way to do this is to draw a sketch, a website blueprint if you will, of what you want the site to look like. This can be a physical drawing or a virtual depiction, and it can be as detailed or simplistic as you desire. Drawing an outline of your site-to-be will save massive amounts of time later because you can get the creative experimentation out of the way before the software design begins. It’s similar to if you look up a menu before you go to a restaurant; if you know what you want before you get there, the rest will run as smooth as ice. Once this has been completed, you are ready to begin the creation process of the website.

The second step in creating a website is forming the backbone. These can be found in the easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy sites of Wix, Weebly, or similar website design programs. That is, if you are determined for your personal website to mirror exactly every other Wix or Weebly site but with a different color palette and font. If that’s your heart’s desire, by all means, use these templates, but personal sites are about expressing yourself, which typically entails more than some pre-existing, automated sculpture of who you ought to be. Ideally, you would code this skeleton of your expression. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are perfect languages for beginner web design. If you’re advanced in website design, Next.js, React.js, and Gatsby.js are great options for personal website design framework. However, if you are not fluent in the world of code but still desire your site to be eye-catchingly unique, don’t fret. There are templates of code, generally in HTML or JavaScript, available FREE online for your convenience. All you need is a little common sense to pick out the variables and change them accordingly until, voila, you have a beautiful outline for your personal site.

Then of course, you must add the basics. For a personal website, you should include a minimum of a bio and a picture. This will show your viewers who you are and what you look like. Then, add examples of your work or a blog that you write or videos you have created or whatever you feel best embodies who you are as a person, as a professional, and as a creator. If you feel that no additional content is necessary to show the world the true you, that’s alright too. Don’t feel pressured to make this look a certain way, and do not simply remake your resume.

Finally, it’s time for the pizazz. Fonts, colors, and effects should decorate your website, bringing it to life. This is where your creative license can really take effect. There are numerous animations, ranging in complexity, and transitions that can spice up your site. You can make tabs appear from all directions or fade in or bounce. You can code it such that icons spin when you hover over them or appear to explode. Regarding site decor, there are only two rules: do not be boring and do not be overly garish. The explanation for this is simple: you want to look cool, but not like you’re trying too hard. Also, you want to hold a reader’s attention, to intrigue them, but not such that you blind them or make their head spin. In short, just be you.

After the website itself is built, it is time to choose a domain. Although these can cost some money, there are free domains available. It is recommended to use your first and last name, first name and last initial, first initial and last name, or some other simple combination of your name for your personal website. This can also help optimize it to search, meaning it will appear near the top of Google (or whatever other search engine you choose to use) when your name is searched. However, if you can get your initials as your domain name, use it. It’s simple, clear, and easily optimizable. This is especially true if your name is common, as otherwise, you will end up caught in a sea of a million Johns, Jacks, Annas, Sarahs, etc. Additionally, you must ensure a reputable extension. These include .dev, .io, .com, .tech, and .me. Steer clear of unusual alternatives such as .xyz. It doesn’t have to be high school research project worthy, but it does have to be normal.

All in all, a personal website should be what you make it, unguided by a Wix template, the expectations of others, or even by a remarkable article you found online. If you make it unique and make it you, there is absolutely no way to mess it up.
