Learning to program is incredibly challenging, especially when you struggle to find the right ways to apply newly learned concepts to the real world. Once you’ve developed your fundamental skills to a certain level, the most effective way to deepen your understanding of any programming language is to build projects.

  

The purpose of programming, after all, is to apply technical skills to projects that benefit others. Even if the projects you start out with aren’t especially useful or glamorous, they’ll introduce important skills such as working around problems, reading documentation, collaborating with others, and applying newly learned concepts.

  

Here are five projects that are great for beginners, regardless of what language you’re building them in:

  

## Mad Libs

  

We all had a blast playing this word game in elementary school, but did you know that building your own Mad Libs program can teach you a lot about string interpolation?  
  
String interpolation, in essence, involves replacing placeholders within a string with their corresponding values. In the case of Mad Libs, the program would have to evaluate the Mad Lib string containing placeholders (blank lines) and replace them with their corresponding string values from the list of words inputted by the user.

  

Although it’s unlikely that anyone will use your program, building your own version of Mad Libs can be conducive to your growth as a programmer. String interpolation is common among many languages, especially ones that often represent data in string form like Swift, Python, Ruby, Perl, and PHP. With that said, the logical thinking patterns that are introduced through Mad Libs—and, by association, string interpolation—are applicable to any language or project.

  
  

## Tic-Tac-Toe

  

Although tic-tac-toe may seem incredibly simple and unremarkable, building your own version of the game exercises many useful programming concepts. Beyond testing your knowledge of variables, functions, and arrays, it also forces you to be creative with user interface and consider the different ways users will interact with the program.

  

For example, players need to be able to choose whether “X” or “O” is going first, and there are endless different ways the program could prompt them to choose. The actual gameplay itself can also be designed based on personal preference. Regardless of how it ends up looking, the experience of building a functioning and visually appealing user interface is also applicable to future projects.

  

As always, there are opportunities to create more challenges, even with something as seemingly basic as tic-tac-toe. This could come in the form of building an artificial intelligence to replace the second player, allowing users to play against a computer.

  
  

## Calculator

  

Similar to tic-tac-toe, building a calculator helps practice and apply many key programming concepts, just on a more difficult scale. Building a calculator in any language will deepen your understanding of a multitude of basic skills that will help you succeed in more challenging projects later on.

  

Depending on your skill level, you can make your calculator as simple or as complex as you please. It’s fairly simple to code a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers, but what if you want to plug multiple numbers into an equation? Your calculator will then need to follow the order of operations. Introducing parentheses, exponents, and simple algebra are also ways to add difficulty to the project. As such, building a calculator can suit all sorts of skill levels; it just depends on how far you want to take it.

  
  

## To-Do List

  

Building a to-do list program can bring organization to your daily life. Beyond this, it develops knowledge of databases, an essential piece of knowledge for more advanced projects. In the most basic version of a to-do list, all list items would disappear once the program is closed or refreshed. But what if you wanted the list items to stay?

  

To ensure that items aren’t lost, the program would need to store them either locally or in a database. Experience with storing data in this way will come in handy when you move on to more complex projects, whether it’s a multi-page website, video game, or application.

  

To make the project even more difficult, you can introduce more advanced features like re-ordering and moving existing list items, customizing reminders for tasks, and connecting the data to a different website or application.

  
  

## Flappy Bird

  

Unsurprisingly, after the original Flappy Bird game was discontinued, the App Store was flooded with parody versions that hoped to rapidly climb the App Store charts, just as the original had.

  

Aside from being infuriating to play, this timeless classic can be infuriating to program as well. Because it’s relatively advanced to make, it will force you to accustom yourself with new libraries like Phaser and PyGame. Being able to learn libraries and look at existing documentation will be a crucial skill for more advanced projects later on.

  

If you’re looking to pull even more experience from this project, you can even try to publish your version of the game on the App Store or Google Play Store. This experience will make it significantly easier to deploy apps in the future.

  
  
  
  

Regardless of whether you choose to make any of these particular projects or come up with your own, building projects is arguably the most important aspect of learning to program.
