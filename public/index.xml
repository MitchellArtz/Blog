      <title>Github: What Is It and Why Should You Use It</title>
      <link>https://www.blog.npocore.com/posts/github/</link>

      <description>Here at Launch Tech, Github is the primary means of software creation. We get updates daily regarding a push, a restructure, an enhancement, etc. It is a one-stop-shop for all of our programming needs, including automatic saving, ease in collaboration, and a simple way to return to older versions of our codes in order to fix bugs or other flaws that may emerge. However, if you are not exposed to someone or a group using the system (or even if you are, and are not in the software development aspect of that place), you likely do not know how Github works or why you should be using it.</description>

      <description>With technology growing increasingly ubiquitous in today’s world, students of all ages and interests aspire to learn to program, thereby enabling them to be changemakers in this digital revolution. The variety of ways to learn, however, poses a difficult question: should I take a programming class or self-study online?
There’s no clear answer. Everybody has a different learning style and objective, and each individual should assess the pros and cons of both methods to determine which best suits their needs.</description>

      <description>As many of today’s youth are aware, due to the infamous task of middle and high school “portfolio” building, personal websites are a great way to express who you are and to show off what you have done to whoever searches your name on Google. Personal websites can be handy when applying for jobs, meeting new people, or simply in establishing yourself in the vast domain of the world wide web.</description>

      <title>5 Projects You Should Build as a Beginner!</title>

      <description>Learning to program is incredibly challenging, especially when you struggle to find the right ways to apply newly learned concepts to the real world. Once you’ve developed your fundamental skills to a certain level, the most effective way to deepen your understanding of any programming language is to build projects.
The purpose of programming, after all, is to apply technical skills to projects that benefit others. Even if the projects you start out with aren’t especially useful or glamorous, they’ll introduce important skills such as working around problems, reading documentation, collaborating with others, and applying newly learned concepts.</description>

      <title>Professional and Independent Software Engineers: What’s the Difference?</title>
      <link>https://www.blog.npocore.com/posts/swe-article/</link>

      <description>Before you can understand the differences between types, it is important to know what a software engineer is. A software engineer is someone who builds applications or software. A professional software engineer is someone who does this for a company or other organization. An independent software engineer is someone who does this of their own accord, bossed by themselves. A professional software engineer, in most cases, is paid for their work.</description>

      <title>Problems in STEM Empowerment</title>

      <description>STEM empowerment, for the most part, is a wonderful movement. It is an encouraging and unconditionally supportive community pushing individuals to pursue their dreams, despite what the rest of the world seems to think. It has had a substantial impact on many of today’s youth, providing opportunities, establishing contacts, and teaching important skills that may not be obtained elsewhere. STEM empowerment provides a degree of equity within the field. It helps those at a disadvantage, whether that originates from socioeconomic status, gender or racial bias, or any other reason one may be hindered from receiving the same education, motivation, and options as others in their prospective fields.</description>

You’ve spent countless hours poring over textbooks and videos, debugging your code, browsing through Stack Overflow, and nearly ripping your hair out in frustration just to get your program to function properly. So why is it just sitting on your hard drive, unused?
Once beginners reach a certain level of technical proficiency, they generally build small projects to practice and apply their skills. What they don’t do, however, is deploy their software and make it available in a live environment.</description>

      <description>Time and time again, teachers, grandparents, parents, and others have been famous for dispelling the use of technology. But what most people fail to realize is the prevalence of technology in our lives. Even if you don’t personally know how to code or do so much as navigate a website without assistance, programming is everywhere.
And to prove it&amp;hellip;
IT/Computer Science
This one is pretty obvious. This field does not incorporate programming; it is programming.</description>

      <description>Whether it’s interest and excitement, pressure from others, the promise of a lucrative career, or something else entirely, you’ve decided to learn how to program.

      <title>How to get started in programming</title>
      <link>https://www.blog.npocore.com/posts/how-to-get-started-in-programming/</link>

      <description>Looking at our own team here at Launch Tech LLC, our programming experience and learning methodology differ significantly. Some of us took online classes in our own free time, some of us built foundations through Roblox or similar gaming sites, and some of us took classes in school. However, no matter where you begin or where you end up, no matter if your desire to program is purely professional, purely passionate, or somewhere in the middle, learning to program will give you the same couple of things: an altered, more logical view of the world, confidence in yourself and your abilities, and a new, highly applicable skill that will help you just about anywhere you go.</description>
