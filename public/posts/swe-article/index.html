<p>Before you can understand the differences between types, it is important to know what a software engineer is. A software engineer is someone who builds applications or software. A professional software engineer is someone who does this for a company or other organization. An independent software engineer is someone who does this of their own accord, bossed by themselves. A professional software engineer, in most cases, is paid for their work. An independent software engineer, in most cases, is not. However, despite this dictionary definition of the two positions, there is so much more to both a professional and an independent software engineer than their corporate status or source of income.</p>
<p>More so than the requirements corresponding with each title, understanding the difference between independent and professional software engineers stems from the implications of being in either position.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent differences is the type of work being done. Of course, in both situations, software is being developed, bugs are being fixed, and applications are being built. However, the two contrasting environments produce very different styles of work. A professional software engineer is responsible for the designing and upkeep of company software. While there may be a degree of creativity allowed, the guidelines for that software are preemptively established. A professional software engineer cannot do whatever they want, whenever they want. A set list of tasks with narrow limitations and specific time tables frequents the assignments given to a software engineer in a professional setting.</p>
<p>An independent software engineer, on the other hand, faces few of these constraints. They have a full creative license on their work with little to no external expectations. Even those that do push their products to the public are not quite as concerned by launch times or public preference as their corporate counterparts. The reason for this is simple: their careers don’t depend upon it. However, this impacts the outcomes. Independent work tends to be more abstract than productivity-based. There is a greater focus on what is being done, the actual programming, than the outcome. While professional programming tends to represent itself as a means to an end, independent programming portrays the journey. Of course, a gray area exists. Corporate programming can incorporate ideational aspects just as easily as it does conventional, and vice versa for independently generated software. Stereotypically, though, the two do express themselves as such.
In addition to the product, differences arise in the process and in the personalities of those who enter each discipline of software engineering. For starters, the professional setting is largely collaborative. Projects are not dependent on one person’s skills or ideas, but multiple. This causes a slower average pace, as compromises must be made and engineers cannot simply work at their own speeds. However, generally, professional products are more applicable to the public eye. More perspectives equals more diversity in the target audience. This does not necessarily attract a certain type of person, but it does repel some. A professional software engineer must have a range of soft skills in addition to their programming and development abilities in order to be happy in such a setting. They must be open-minded and patient with others. They cannot become so insistent on their ideas that they fail to see others. That just doesn’t work in a professional environment. They also must be willing to hold back at times and let others take the reins. They need to be comfortable asking for help. In a team environment, which is most common among professional software engineer settings, one must be willing to act as a unit, not just themselves.
An independent, on the other hand, has to work by themselves. They have to be ambitious and find solutions to their problems on their own. Independent software engineering requires originality and self-motivation. There isn’t a standard to be upheld or a guideline to follow. Additionally, an independent software engineer must be more versatile. In the corporate world, there is a designated position for everything. There is someone who has the job of fixing bugs. There is someone who is entitled the writer of a specific area of code for a specific piece of software. In independent software engineering, the proprietor must do it all. They must fix the bugs, program the software, come up with new ideas and updates, and everything else.
Despite the differences between independent and professional software engineers, it is important to recognize the similarities. They both use the same basis, use similar techniques and skills, and create similar types of products. Whether they are bound to a contract or doing it on their own free will, the work itself is largely the same. In fact, most professionals began as independent software engineers. They learned from the same schools, the same classes. Despite their varying implications, the difference between professional and independent software engineers is who chose to make a career out of it.</p>
