<p>With technology growing increasingly ubiquitous in today’s world, students of all ages and interests aspire to learn to program, thereby enabling them to be changemakers in this digital revolution. The variety of ways to learn, however, poses a difficult question: should I take a programming class or self-study online?</p>
<p>There’s no clear answer. Everybody has a different learning style and objective, and each individual should assess the pros and cons of both methods to determine which best suits their needs. Here are some factors to consider:</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>In general, a self-studying approach is more effective when you have a clear objective in mind. If there’s a specific project you want to build, whether it’s an app, website, video game, or something else, then online tutorials may be the best option for you. When searching for resources online, you’re in full control of the aspect of programming you’d like to focus on. All you need to do is type the language, framework, or library you want to learn about into your search engine, and before you know it, the internet’s plethora of resources will be at your disposal. It’s quite literally as simple as the click of a button.</p>
<p>While this is convenient for people who have a project idea—along with an understanding of which languages and technologies it requires—the sheer vastness of the field can be daunting for those without prior knowledge. In this case, self-guided research often creates a spiral into the practically endless pit of confusing terminology.</p>
<p>If you fall into this category, registering for a class may be the best option for you. With others guiding your progress and choosing which concepts to focus on, this is the perfect opportunity for you to get your feet wet. People who already have ideas of languages they want to learn and projects they want to build might be annoyed or held back by the fact that they can’t direct their own learning, but people without a specific goal in mind will benefit from the structure of a classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Inherent motivation</strong></p>
<p>Let’s face it: sometimes, it’s difficult to be productive without the external pressure of deadlines. It’s significantly easier to give up on projects when others aren’t holding you accountable, especially with something as challenging as programming. Those who have trouble holding themselves accountable will likely benefit from the relative rigidity of a classroom environment.</p>
<p>It’s also easy to lose motivation when you can’t solve a problem or don’t know what to do next, which increases the odds that you abandon your project. In a classroom, however, instructors can guide you through any roadblocks you face, which will usually help you achieve success more often and more quickly. This instant gratification can also boost your motivation—and, as a result—your interest in programming.</p>
<p>That being said, struggling through these challenges alone often helps students develop a stronger understanding of programming concepts. Although instant gratification is nice, it can be incredibly fulfilling to succeed after long hard hours at the keyboard, which can also heighten your interest in the subject. Most importantly, it will make you better at handling setbacks in the future.</p>
<p>Overall, the amount of inherent interest you have in programming is a large factor in determining the best way for you to learn. If you think you may need extrinsic motivation in order to work productively, learning in a classroom is likely the best option for you; otherwise, self-studying may be your bestchoice.</p>
<p><strong>Learning style</strong></p>
<p>Everybody has unique preferences when it comes to the methods they use to absorb information. While some people might prefer to learn through visual and/or auditory examples, others might need to navigate tasks by themselves in order to truly understand the process.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are typically options that suit all learning styles regardless of whether you’re in a classroom or on the internet. Both online resources and teaching methods grow more and more holistic every year. However, the two options emphasize different areas: traditional classroom environments often favor lecture-style teaching, while self-studying caters towards hands-on learning.</p>
<p>Another significant aspect of learning that differs from person to person is pace. In a classroom, the speed at which you learn is generally determined for you and remains relatively constant from day to day. Meanwhile, self-studying allows for much more flexibility; you direct your own pace and have permission to change it at your leisure. However, as aforementioned, this can make it difficult to follow through with projects and lessons if you lack ample motivation.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you choose to self-study or sign up for a class, each option has its advantages and disadvantages. Oftentimes, however, neither option can hurt; it can even be beneficial to try both. If you want to learn to program, the most important thing is to just get started and to stick with it as best as you can.</p>
